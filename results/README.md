# Experimental Results

This directory contains detailed results tables from the computational experiments described in our paper, "[The Iterative Chainlet Partitioning Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone and Neural Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15147)".

The tables compare the performance of our proposed ICP and Neuro-ICP (NICP) algorithms against other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark instances.

**All tables are available in the following file:**
